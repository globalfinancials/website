                <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Acme Retail Co. was a familiar name in its market, but its balance sheet was a disaster.

                <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                    Within 18 months, Acme Retail had shed its most toxic debt and transformed its operating model. They moved from a **net loss of 8% to a strong 15% annual profit margin**. By making necessary, data-backed decisions, they successfully pivoted from a dying legacy brand into a lean, profitable enterprise.
