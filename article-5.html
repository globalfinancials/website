                    "We were terrified to raise prices and lose our loyal customers. Our accountant showed us the profit margin on every single cup."

                <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    'The Daily Grind' was a community cornerstone, but when global coffee, milk, and energy prices soared, their already thin profit margins began to evaporate. The owners knew they had to act, but feared a blanket price increase would alienate their dedicated customer base and drive them to competitors. They needed surgical precision, not a blunt instrument.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4 mt-8">The Global Financials Solution</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    We implemented a detailed **Unit Cost and Contribution Margin Analysis** for their top 50 menu items. This revealed surprising truths about which drinks were carrying the most profit:

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 space-y-2 pl-4">
                    <li>**Targeted Pricing:** Raised prices slightly (less than \$0.50) on 5 items with the highest demand and lowest visibility.</li>
                    <li>**Cost Engineering:** Found a new, equally high-quality milk supplier, reducing dairy costs by 15%.</li>
                    <li>**Menu Optimization:** Used the data to promote the highest-margin items through strategic placement on the menu board.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4 mt-8 text-blue-600">The Result: Margin Growth</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                    The Daily Grind successfully absorbed the rising inflation. Their average **transaction margin increased by 7%**, achieved almost entirely through cost engineering and targeted pricing, proving that intelligent financial strategy can protect both your profits and your loyal customers.
