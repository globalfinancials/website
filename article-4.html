                <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    'Global Distribution Solutions' had successfully scaled their sales by offering generous credit terms to large clients. However, their Accounts Receivable (money owed to them) skyrocketed while their Accounts Payable (money they owed) lagged only slightly behind. They were always waiting 60-90 days for client payments while suppliers demanded 30-day terms. They were a profitable company with **no immediate cash**. This is the classic "Growth Trap."

                <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    We designed a robust Working Capital Management framework to bridge the gap between sales and cash collection:

                    <li>**Credit Policy Reform:** Instituted a tiered credit approval system based on client history, reducing exposure to late payers.</li>
                    <li>**Accelerated Collections:** Implemented a firm, automated invoicing and follow-up system that cut the average collection period by 25 days.</li>
                    <li>**Supplier Negotiation:** Leveraged strong financial data to negotiate extended payment terms with their largest suppliers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4 mt-8 text-blue-600">The Result: Liquidity and Stability</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                    Global Distribution moved from constant scrambling to one of the **most liquid companies in their sector**. They learned that the true measure of success isn't just revenue, but the health of your cash cycle. They can now scale sales aggressively, confident that their working capital can handle the growth.
