                <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    'Mid-State Manufacturing' had always prioritized production over paperwork. Their finance team was busy managing day-to-day transactions but lacked the expertise to navigate complex international trade and licensing requirements. They were unknowingly operating with outdated protocols that exposed them to a devastating fine from a federal regulatory body.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4 mt-8 text-blue-600">The Result: $1M Fine Averted</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                    The federal inspection occurred just three months later. Because of our preemptive work, the firm passed with flying colors, **avoiding a potential \$1 million penalty** and reputational damage that could have closed the business. Sometimes, the greatest financial success is the disaster you never face.
